# GDP-Analysis
GDP Analysis conducted on all states within India

A project was initiated wherein we will provide top-level recommendations of various states which will help prioritise 
areas of development for their respective states. Since different states are in different phases of development,
the recommendations should be specific to states as well.

The overall goal of this project is to help the CMs focus on areas which will foster economic development for their respective states. 
Since the most common measure of economic development is the GDP, we will analyse the GDP of the various states of India and 
suggest ways to improve it.
